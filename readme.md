# Bus Stop Teleport

A plugin for the Game [Rust](https://rust.facepunch.com/) that allows players to teleport between bus stops.

The plugin finds bus stops close to monuments and custom markers and makes the bus stops mountable. When mounted, a destination bus stop can be selected and the player is teleported there.
